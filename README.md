# Instagram Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This Python project analyzes Instagram data to uncover engagement trends, reach patterns, and follower growth insights. The analysis focuses on key metrics such as Likes, Comments, Saves, Shares, Profile Visits, and Follows.

## Key Steps
- *Data Cleaning & Preparation:* Removed duplicates, standardized column names, and created new features like caption length, hashtag count, explore rate, trend level, and engagement rate.  
- *Engagement & Reach Analysis:* Calculated percentages from different sources (Home, Explore, Other) and analyzed their effect on post performance.  
- *Follower Growth Insights:* Explored correlation between profile visits and new followers, identifying strong drivers of audience growth.  
- *Content Impact Study:* Examined the effect of caption and hashtag length on impressions and engagement.  
- *Visualizations:* Used bar charts, scatter plots, heatmaps, and word clouds to illustrate key patterns and trends.

## Key Findings
- High-quality, engaging content drives reach and follower growth more effectively than long captions or numerous hashtags.  
- Posts with strong interactions (likes, saves, comments, shares) consistently gain higher visibility.  
- Tech and coding-related posts were the top performers in terms of reach and engagement.
